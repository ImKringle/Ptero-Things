# Hogwarp Server Versions

This folder contains the server-side files for the **Hogwarp** project, specifically the server part of the release candidates. These files are intended **solely for use with my Hogwarp eggs**.

I am not affiliated with the development team behind Hogwarp, or the Hogwarts Legacy team. Just someone who likes the game and wants to keep my egg nice and clean :)

## Important

**These files are not the complete mod or download.** They are only the server part of the release candidate. 

For the full mod and the client files, please visit the official **Hogwarp Discord** to download the full version of the mod and get support from the community:

## Usage

These server files are meant to be used with the `egg` files for setting up your own multiplayer server
