# HogWarp
[HogWarp] is a Work In Progress mod that adds Multiplayer functionality to Hogwarts Legacy, similar to FiveM for GTAV

This Mod requires a API key only obtainable through their Discord, see the Startup Variable **API KEY** for more info.
- Some features of the mod (Public servers / higher player counts) require a Patreon level. See their Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/tiltedphoques

# Updating Info
As [Hogwarps] Linux build is solely in a Docker image, updates to the version on my end may be slow ~ though you can ping me on Discord in the Hogwarp server to rebuild it manually. Image is rebuilt once a week automatically.
