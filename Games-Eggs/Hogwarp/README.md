# HogWarp
[HogWarp](https://hogwarp.com/news) is a Work In Progress mod that adds Multiplayer functionality to Hogwarts Legacy, similar to FiveM for GTAV

This Mod requires a API key only obtainable through their Discord, see the Startup Variable `API_KEY` for more info.
> Some features of the mod (Public servers / higher player counts) require a Patreon level. You can find their Patreon [here](https://www.patreon.com/tiltedphoques)

# Updating Info
As [Hogwarps](https://hogwarp.com/news) Linux build is solely in a Docker image, updates to the version on my end may be slow. Though you can ping me on Discord in the Hogwarp server to rebuild it manually (via @ImKringle)
> *Image is rebuilt once a month (first Monday) automatically.*
