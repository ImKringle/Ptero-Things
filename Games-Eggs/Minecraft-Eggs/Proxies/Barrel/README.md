# Barrel
### This Server JAR is VERY Experimental! Once fully built this will change to pull from https://github.com/BarrelMC/Barrel. Do not expect this to work well if you use it!
[Barrel] is essentially GeyserMC but in reverse. This egg adds the ability to connect to Minecraft Bedrock servers from Minecraft Java

**Note: This software only allows a specific version to connect via both Java and Bedrock, also the Bedrock server must be running PocketMineMP. It is not intended for use with Vanilla Bedrock**
