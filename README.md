# Ptero-Things
A collection of things for Pterodactyl. Images, Eggs, Install scripts etc as I use them

Some made by me, others are off the interwebs

This is no specific order, but will be updated as more get made ðŸ‘€
- **Note**: Eggs here may not be fully ready for use. Please read the README before opening any issue

<p align="center">
If reading this you may not know how to install an Egg, follow these steps!
1. Download any of the json files located in the folders below.
-> It's easiest to right click the raw button and save as.
2. In your panel go to the Nests section in the admin part of the panel
3. Click the green Import Egg button
4. Browse to the json file you saved earlier
5. Select what nest you want to put the egg in.
Note:If you want a new nest you need to create it before importing the egg.
